# JSP-Essentials
JSP Essentials adds some of the core features of every bedrock edition server.

## Current Features:
- chatFormat: Allows to custom prefix and suffix setting. Helpful for creating server ranks.
- dynamicMotd: Allows you to display as many messages as you want to the server selection screen for your server.
- dynamicPlayerCount: Displays the current amount of players on the server selection screen with the max player count 1 count higher than the total online players.
- economyAPI: Adds the basic commands and functions for a server using a currency system. Functions are accessible from other plugins via requiring the basePlugin of JSP-ES.
- webChat: Sends every chat message to a specific webhook url.

## TODO:
- Add tps / warp systems
- Make all functions accessible from other plugins
